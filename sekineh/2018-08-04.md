# Objective

- experiment with the better way of running cargo in CI.
- Looking into `cargotest`

### tl;dr

- It is difficult to run `cargotest` in a reliable manner.
- It's not sure that it supports cross build.

### How to run for HOST arch

#### Try1: try to run in my workdir (failed)

You can run by:
```
sekineh@sekineh-VirtualBox:~/rustme7$ ./x.py test src/tools/cargotest/
```
Failed.  My guess is if you change `--target` option, you need to run it again from scratch tree.

#### Try2: build from scratch (succeed but not run?)

Retry from the beginning:
```
git clone https://github.com/sekineh/rust rustme8
cd rustme8
./x.py test src/tools/cargotest/ --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,i686-unknown-linux-gnu,thumbv7m-none-eabi 2>&1 | tee cargotest.log
```

I added 3 targets; 64bit Linux, 32bit Linux, and thumbv7m in this order. And they suceeded.

```
(snip)
    Finished dev [unoptimized] target(s) in 42.96 secs
Build completed successfully in 0:09:35
```

#### Try3

Run without `--target` option
```
./x.py test src/tools/cargotest/ 2>&1 | tee cargotest-2.log
```

The log shows that it now doing extra jobs than Try2.
It failed finally.

#### Try5: Use upstream master

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust rust9
cd rust9
./x.py test src/tools/cargotest/ 2>&1 | tee cargotest-5.log
```

It failed. The log:
