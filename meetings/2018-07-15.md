# Agenda

## Review Previous Week

### Hideki

Done:
- wrote bug description of x.py test issue
- open the issue in the rust main repository.
- git rebase my repo to the current upstream/master

Todo:
- Try to prototype one of the test. Iâ€™m going to use other target and crates as a temporary placeholder because for thumb target, test harness is not functional so far.
