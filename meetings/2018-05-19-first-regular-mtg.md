## Discussion Items

This is the first week of the "learning section". I would like the team to focus on getting up to speed with the following items:

* Make sure everyone has a good understanding of what our goals are
* Review skills that will be useful for this work:
    * Docker (CI tests are run in a Docker Context)
    * Rust
        * General knowledge
        * Building an embedded example
    * Linux
    * QEMU (but we will probably get to this later in the program)
* Review useful links
    * CI for the Rust compiler [lives here]
    * [old blog post] about the "new" CI system
    * [guide for using CI images] inside the CI repo
    * [stm32f103xx-hal] crate is probably a good place for initial testing
    * [discovery guide] is a little outdate, but good for a first read

## Plan for this week

(initial thoughts from James):

* Focus on learning
* Getting an understanding of how the CI system works
* Blog posts or README changes about stuff we've learned?
