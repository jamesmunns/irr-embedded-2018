## Discussion Items

* See if we can make a break through this week!
    * Change up working style?
    * Try and find times to align?
* Who can we ask for help? What do we need help with?
    * "How do I do this?"
    * "What am I missing?"
    * "Who can help?"
* Important Dates, in reverse order
    1. 2018-10-25 - Rust 1.30 (2018 Edition) ships
    2. 2018-09-13 - Rust 1.29 ships, code must be in Beta to ship with 2018 release
    3. 2018-08-02 - Rust 1.28 ships
    4. 2018-07-08 - Today!
* Identify Must-Haves vs Nice to Haves for Edition Release
    * Tests planned:
        * Adding "it compiles" tests. libcore, or some other crate, compiles for $TARGET
        * Adding "it links" tests. A minimal embedded program links with different compiler options (opt-level, LTO, incremental, etc.) and the presence of some symbols is checked (e.g. main).
        * Adding "it runs" tests. A embedded program is executed in QEMU and completes successfully.
        * Adding binary size regression tests. The binary size of a program, compiled with opt-level=s, is tracked over time (per PR) and the CI fails if the binary size of the program regresses.
